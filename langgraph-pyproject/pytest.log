2024-10-29 19:35:59 [    INFO] Based on the provided monthly breakdown, I've analyzed the expenses and identified potential anomalies. Here's the result in JSON format:

```json
{
  "issues": [
    {
      "April 2023": "The Water expense is negative (-80), which is unusual and might be an error or a credit."
    },
    {
      "June 2023": "The Water expense is negative (-80) again, which is unusual and might be an error or a credit."
    },
    {
      "July 2023": "The Mortgage Interest expense is missing, which is typically a monthly expense."
    },
    {
      "July 2023": "The Water expense is negative (-6.63), which is unusual and might be an error or a credit."
    },
    {
      "August 2023": "The Water expense is missing, which is typically a monthly expense."
    },
    {
      "September 2023": "The Water expense is negative (-28), which is unusual and might be an error or a credit."
    },
    {
      "September 2023": "The Management Fees are significantly lower than usual (31.64 vs. typically over 100)."
    },
    {
      "November 2023": "The Water expense is much higher than usual (189.6 vs. typically around 30-45)."
    },
    {
      "January 2024": "The Management Fees are missing, which is typically a monthly expense."
    },
    {
      "February 2024": "The Water expense is missing, which is typically a monthly expense."
    },
    {
      "February 2024": "The Management Fees are significantly higher than usual (552.83 vs. typically around 100-200)."
    }
  ]
}
```

This JSON output highlights potential anomalies in the monthly expenses, including missing payments, unusual negative values, and significant deviations from typical expense amounts. (company_insights.py:44)
